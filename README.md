A simple first-aid mobile application. It consists of basic first-aid tutorials for minor incidents and medical hotlines/facilities, as well as medical facts/myths that can be heard or seen only in the philippines. The location of medical facilities and emergency hotlines are specific to the target area we have selected during the development of this project. You can use AidPack as a reference for your own project or modify it base on your preference! :) 

P.S this is my first application development *Do not expect!!*
